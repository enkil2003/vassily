These are a few workarounds for problems that I had trying to setup a new environment under linux.

you could have to create if not exists and check for the file/directory permission to be 777 on:

trunk/logs/apache/access.log
trunk/logs/apache/deflate.log
trunk/logs/apache/error.log
trunk/logs/php/error.log
trunk/application/cache
